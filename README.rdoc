== DESCRIPTION:

IMAPProcessor is a client for processing messages on an IMAP server.  It
provides some basic mechanisms for connecting to an IMAP server, determining
capabilities and handling messages.

IMAPProcessor ships with several executables which can query and
manipulate IMAP mailboxes in several different ways:

imap_archive  :: Archives old messages to a new dated mailbox.
imap_cleanse  :: Delete messages older than a certain age in specified mailboxes.
imap_flag     :: Flag messages to/from certain people.
imap_idle     :: Shows new messages in a mailbox.
imap_keywords :: Queries an IMAP server for keywords set on messages
imap_learn    :: Flags messages based on what you've flagged before.
imap_mkdir    :: Ensures that certain mailboxes exist.
